# Emotion Bubbles ðŸŒˆ

Welcome to "Emotion Bubbles"! This interactive website visualizes the whirlwind of human emotions through colorful and dynamic bubbles. Each bubble represents a unique emotion derived from real Twitter messages, inviting users to discover and connect with the global emotional pulse shared on social media.
